<h1>Adnan's LSRP 2025:</h1>

<p>Welcome to my study notes for 2025. I use a number of different devices including linux machines without GUI's so I wanted some way of accessing my notes on any platform.

Also learning webdev and thought this would be a fun way to learn by doing.

Please do not make changes to my repo. If you want to make changes please fork it instead.</p>
