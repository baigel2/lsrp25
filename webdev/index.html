<h1>Welcome to the homepage for the webdev section.</h1>

<p>I'm a real noob with this as I've only ever used tools like wix, squarespace and hugo to make sites before. This project is my first attempt at doing things from scratch.
<br>
At the moment I'm going to work through the courses at <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>
<br>
I'm following the full stack javascript path. Not much more to say yet. I'll put keep my notes in this section.</p>
