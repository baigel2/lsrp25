# Mindfulness in Salah. Borrowing from Buddhism.

Ask yourself a question. When was the last time you were so focused in your salah that you had no thoughts in your mind except the words you were reciting and the closeness to Allah?

I think for me, this level of focus in prayer has only happened once or maybe twice in my life. Even at times when I've been cryingin prayer, distracting thoughts have still managed to weesle their way into my mind.

## A possible solution?

Mindfulness.

A concept honed in buddhism but likely something that has existed for much much longer. Mindfullness is to focus what weights are to muscles. It's where you literally train by focusing.

In buddhism you focus on a single thing during a session of meditation. Usually this is either your breath or a mantra or some sound like a bell or something similar.

In Salah we recite the Quran along with other supplications as well as obviously praising God.

So, why not use the words you are ssaying as the focal point of the mindfullness exercise?

I'll try this moving forward and update this site with my progress.
