# Welcome to my homepage for Islam.

I am currently learning through practice about Shia Islam so you will likeley see notes about Shi'sm here more than Sunni'ism for now.

If I had a choice I would simply call myself muslim and not shia or sunni or anything else. If there was a scale where 1 was Shia and 10 was Sunni Islam I'd currently put myself at a 4 or maybe a 3.5.

I know very little about Islam in general though I was brought up in a muslim family I only really know the basics and I have left Islam for long periods in the past and practiced other faiths.

I can say however that at the moment I feel at home in Shia Islam and I'm eager to learn and spread more knowlage about it as there is far less information out there for shiaism than for sunnism.
