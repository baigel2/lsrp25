<h1>Welcome to my Unix homepage.</h1>

<p>This is where I'll store notes on Linux/BSD stuff. I may also include a dotfiles folder or I might make that a separate repo not sure yet.

Currently I have the following machines and os's:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Macbook air 13" - main pc.</li>
<li>Dell Inspiron 15" - Tinkering pc running debian with i3 and dwm. No login manager by I might use ly.</li>
<li>Samsung NC10 netbook. - Debian 12 no gui. This is my dedicated distraction free writing machine so I deliberately installed debian on it without a gui as I love to use the tty. Pretty sure I'd like to live in it for at least a while someday!</li>
</ul>

<br>
I'll add some resources shortly.
