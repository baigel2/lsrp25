# Welcome to my Unix homepage.

This is where I'll store notes on Linux/BSD stuff. I may also include a dotfiles folder or I might make that a separate repo not sure yet.

Currently I have the following machines and os's:

* Macbook air 13" - main pc.
* Dell Inspiron 15" - Tinkering pc running debian with i3 and dwm. No login manager by I might use ly.
* Samsung NC10 netbook. - Debian 12 no gui. This is my dedicated distraction free writing machine so I deliberately installed debian on it without a gui as I love to use the tty. Pretty sure I'd like to live in it for at least a while someday!

I'll add some resources shortly.
