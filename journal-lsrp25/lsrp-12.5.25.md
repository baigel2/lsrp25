## I just wanna live!

The main reason (or one of them) I wanted to learn new things besides just being interested in them as hobbies was to find a way to make enough money consistently either working online or remotely from home (isn't that the same thing?) to be able to support my dream lifestyle:

A roof over my head. Bread on my table and a car suitable for helping my parents and grandparents get around.

That's basically it. As well as being able to work from anywhere.

Aside from this, the less interaction I had with other homo sapiens the better. Like yeah, introvert.

I've looked briefly at starting my own charities/businesses, becoming an author, learning full stack web development but nothing seems to have quite the same appeal as trading does at the moment.

It's worth noting my attitude will likeley keep changing as time passes but I cant think of anything else at the moment that would allow me the potential of making a full itme income with so little work comparitivley and with so little (basically zero kelvin) interaction with other people. **I love it!** Or at least, the idea of it.

I will be learning at my own pace though which means it will likeley take longer than it would for most others.
