# Monday 12th May 2025 - 12.05.2025:

**Goals for today:**

Learn and define the following:

* Stop Loss.
* Currency Pairs.
* Take Profit.

## Initial Hypothesis:

The terms seam fairly self explanitory so maybe I'm overthinking things when I say I don't know what they are.

Lets have a go anyway:

**Take Profit:**

I'm guessing the market is always either going to be trending up, down or sometimes moving on a horizontal though I think that would be less likely. So, when you place an order anticipating an upward and then downward trend, you might set a take profit so that you're ideally pulled out of the order as close to the top of a peak as possible but before the downward trend starts.


**Stop Loss:**

Again, as the name suggests I'm guessing that stop loss helps to prevent you from losing too much money. If you've placed an order and the market is trending downwards you might (in advance of placing your order) set a stop loss so that if it drops to a a certain point you're automatically pulled out of an order so that you don't lose any more money.

**Currency Pairs:**

Something tells me that this is as simple as the previous two concepts but I'm still not for some reason wrapping my head around it.

When you place an order in the FOREX market you are exchanging one currency for another. For example you might buy some US Dollars with Great British Pounds.

At the time of writing this GBP/USD is at 1.3183 which means that £1 is worth $1.3183 USD. Now its actually at 1.3182 which is showing a slight downward trend.

**Breaking down the pair:**

When a currency pair is displayed there is one currency and then another. In trading view this is like: GBPUSD. The first currency is listed as the base currency and the second is the quote currency. This tells us that £1 is worth $1.3182.


Lets look at some other pairs to see if I've got the hang of it:

EURUSD 1.1094 €1 is $1.1094

USDJPY 148.30 $1 is 148.30JPY

Copilots review of my notes:

# Review & Refinement - Monday 12th May 2025

## Take Profit:
Your definition is solid! The key point to remember is that a **take profit order automatically closes your trade when the price reaches your desired profit level**. It ensures you lock in gains before the market potentially reverses. 

Additionally, price movements can be horizontal in periods of **consolidation**, where buyers and sellers are somewhat balanced, leading to sideways price action.

## Stop Loss:
You nailed it! A **stop loss** is designed to **limit potential losses** by automatically closing a trade when the price reaches a predetermined level. 

However, one key consideration: stop loss placement varies depending on **market volatility**. In highly volatile markets, setting a stop loss too tight might lead to a premature exit due to short-term price fluctuations.

## Currency Pairs:
Your breakdown is correct! The **base currency** is the first currency in the pair, and the **quote currency** is the second currency, representing how much of the quote currency is needed to buy **one unit** of the base currency.

Examples:
- **EUR/USD 1.1094** → €1 is worth **$1.1094 USD** 
- **USD/JPY 148.30** → $1 is worth **148.30 JPY** 

### Additional Insight:
When trading forex, currency pairs are always quoted in terms of **bid and ask prices**:
- The **bid price** is the price at which buyers are willing to purchase the base currency.
- The **ask price** is the price at which sellers are willing to sell it.
- The **spread** (difference between bid and ask) is how brokers make money.
