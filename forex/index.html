<h1>Welcome to my FOREX homepage.</h1>

<p>Life is only ever going to get more and more expensive so I can either have a sex change and change my name to Karen to make a career out of complaining about it or I can learn how to make my money work for me instead of the other way around.</p>

<p>I'm choosing the second option because it's cheaper and much <strong>much</strong> easier!</p>

<p>I'll put any notes on forex in this section of the site. First priority is learning the basic terminology.</p>


<h2>Some basic FOREX terminology:</h2>

<p>
Here is a list of some of the most basic terminology. As a complete and absolute beginner these are the terms I need to learn first so that I'm able to understand anything at all moving forward.
</p>

<p>Looking online it seems like most explinations assume some basic knowlage of financial jargon which I do not yet have. So, I will attemt to reverse engineer (guestimate really) my own explainations for the following terms:</p>

<p> Next to each term I will put a number between 1 and 10 indicating how much I think I understand the term. 0 being absolute zero in which case there will be no explination after the term and 10 being I know as much about the concept as George Soros.</p>

<h3>FOREX 1:</h3>

<p>Why not start with the name? FOREX stands for Foreign Exchange and refers to the trading of one currency for another. For example if you live in England and you want to go to America you would exchange British Pounds Â£ for American Dollars $.</p>

<p>In the most simple terms (don't worry, I'm mansplaining to myself here), FOREX trader will buy a currency when it's value is low and sell the currency when the value is high to make a profit.</p>

<p>I still need to learn more but this is the most basic explination I can think of.</p>



<h3>
Stop Loss 0.1:
</h3>

<p>
Based on the name I'm assuming this is something that hopefully stops you from losing money in a trade.
