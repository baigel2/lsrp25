LSRP - Life Studies Research Project 2025

Using this repo as my note taking app specifically for subjects I'm tryin to learn. I want to use git because I have several different machines on different OS's including tty only linux machines so I need something that'll work anywhere.

A list of subjects I'm learning for now (will add more as I need to):

## FOREX Trading.

As an absolute noob I need to start from the very beginning but if within 2-3 years I can match my dayjobs income that would be great.

## Islam:

As a muslim seeking knowlage is an obligation and there is always more to learn when it comes to religion.

## Webdev:

Full stack web development because I'd like to have my very own websites on my very own servers not on 3rd party tools like wix where if they cease to be I lose my site. Also, I'd love to know more about server admin.

## Hobbies:

* I'd also like to learn more about Linux and BSD but these are not absolutely essential outside of the webdev scope.

* Anything that takes my fancy.

# Sites:

I have one website running at the moment baigelbytes.com which is really more of an online journal which I don't advertise too much.

I want to make another blog site which is more focused on Islam and that will also help raise money for places in need like Palestine. It's a work in progress right now but once it's done I'll definitely be promoting that.
